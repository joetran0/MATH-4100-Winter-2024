        <h1>MATH 4100 Topics in Mathematics Education: Theory and Practice (Winter 2024)</h1>

        <h2>Overview of MATH 4100 Topics in Mathematics Education</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Provides opportunities for students to examine topics in mathematics, and themes in mathematics education. The main focus will be on developing students' ability to unpack and communicate concepts in mathematics, and to think critically about what mathematicians do and what students do when they are learning mathematics.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        <p>A minimum of 21 credits in SC/MATH courses without second digit "5"; permission of the course coordinator.</p>

        <h3>Textbook/Resources</h3>

        <h2>Format</h2>

        Starting Monday, January 8, in-person lectures will be given at 1:30-4:30 PM every Monday (ACE 003).

        <h2>Assignments and Score</h2>

        <h3>Weekly Readings via Kritik (20% of total score)</h3>

        <p>On a regular schedule, there will be an assigned reading on which you will be expected to reflect. Each reading follows a three-stage cycle that will take 3 weeks to complete. The entire reading process will happen using Kritik software.
        <ul>
            <li>Stage 1: CREATE. Read the assigned article and write a short reflection (500 words max).</li>
            <li>Stage 2: EVALUATE. You will be randomly assigned four reflections written by other students. You will evaluate and comment on their submissions.</li>
            <li>Stage 3: FEEDBACK. You will have the opportunity to rate and provide feedback on the written evaluations you received from your peers.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Reflection Assignments (45% of total score)</h3>

        <p>Pick any mathematics topic and reflect on the teaching and learning of this topic. It is expected that as part of your analysis you will draw upon and utilize concepts we have discussed in class, your personal experiences as both a learner and educator of mathematics and any inspiration you have acquired in your conversations with the other students in this class. The purpose of these assignment is for you to demonstrate that you have fully engaged with the content we have discussed in our class meeting time.</p>

        <h3>Class Participation (10% of total score)</h3>

        <p>Class participation will be graded holistically using the WAVE model (Written, Attendance, Verbal, and Effort). Written assessment, for example, may consist of the submission of class exit tickets. Verbal assessment, for example, may consist of the quality of your contributions to the class discussion and activities. Each of these components will be assessed on an overall basis and not week-to-week.</p>

        <h3>Communication Project (25% of total score)</h3>

        <p>Pick a mathematical topic and apply educational topics from this course to teach the topic to an audience of your choosing. This project can take many forms such as the creation of a short educational video, an infographic, a manipulative or interactive tool (this list is not exhaustive). As part of your project, you will write a detailed reflection justifying, defending, and explaining your choices.</p>

        <h2>Letter Grade</h2>

        <p>The final score will be calculated based on homework assignments (30%), the midterm exam (30%), and the final exam (40%). Your letter grade will then be assigned based on the standard York University undergraduate grading scheme: 90.00%-100.00% A+, 80.00%-89.99% A, 75.00%-79.99% B+, 70.00%-74.99% B, 65.00%-69.99% C+, 60.00%-64.99% C, 55.00%-59.99% D+, 50.00%-54.99% D, 40.00%-49.99% E, 0-39.99% F.</p>

        <h2>Lecture Notes</h2>

        <p>In-person notes will be uploaded here. It is best to attend in-person classes as often as possible.</p>
